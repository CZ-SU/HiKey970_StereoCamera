Note: This is my first project in Github!
I don't How to upload a project and give the detailed steps well actually. I just upload the project now.
Maybe I can make it better later.

Description: This is a simple demo of Hikey970 application. It aims to make it more convenient for blind. 
Using principle of binocular measurement, the project contains three parts.
1. Hikey970 connects the Stereocamera(UVCs). (Thank to https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera; Thank to saki!)
2. It uses AI algorithm to detect simple things. (an open source, Google SSD detect-tflite demo)
3. According to the measurement principle, it gets the distance from the barriers to the stereocamera and 
   turns the imformation to sound for the blind. 

Contain:
Original HiKey970 and a stereocamera(UVCs)
